Sudsy
=====
Sudsy is a Drupal theme based on Susy, a Sass-based layout engine.

Requirements
============
1. Sass v3.3 or higher (see http://sass-lang.com/ for more information)
  a. Sudsy uses Susy, which in turn depends on Sass. If you don't know Sass, then this theme is probably not for you. There are numerous free online tutorials on Sass.
  b. You can check which version of Sass is on your system by typing "sass -v" (without quotes) into the command line interface (CLI) on your system. If it returns anything other than the word "Sass" followed by a number less than 3.3, then you need to upgrade the version of Sass that you have installed.
2. Susy version 2.0 or higher (see http://susy.oddbird.net/ for more information)
