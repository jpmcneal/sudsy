# Sudsy
Sudsy is a Drupal 8 theme based on Susy, a Sass-based layout engine.

## Requirements

### 1. Sass v3.3 or higher (see http://sass-lang.com/ for more information)
  * Sudsy uses Susy, which in turn depends on Sass. If you don't know Sass,
  then this theme is probably not for you. There are numerous free online
  tutorials on Sass.
  * You can check which version of Sass is on your system by typing "sass -v" 
  (without quotes) into the command line interface (CLI) on your system. If it
  returns anything other than the word "Sass" followed by a number less than
  3.3, then you need to upgrade the version of Sass that you have installed.
  
### 2. Susy version 2.0 or higher (see http://susy.oddbird.net/ for more information).
  There are a few different ways to install Susy. Compass is
  preferred, but any of them will work.
 
 * Compass: http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/install/#id1
 * Bundler or Rails: http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/install/#bundler-or-rails
 * Grunt (and Yeoman): http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/install/#grunt-and-yeoman
 * Manually: http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/install/#manual-start

### 3. Compass v1.0.1 or higher (see http://compass-style.org/ for more information)
  Compass is optional, but recommended.
